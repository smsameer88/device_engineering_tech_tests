## Architecture

The App is not organized into multiple modules following the principles of the Presentation, Domain,
and Data Layers. The presentation layer handles the UI work with the logic contained in the **
ViewModel**. The UI uses a **LiveData** object from the ViewModel and observes it using the **
Observer Pattern**. A ListAdapter handles the actual displaying of the news. Data over the network
is retrieved using
**retrofit**, **Flow** and **coroutines** to handle background work asynchronously. Additionally,
note that the ViewModel uses the **viewModelScope** to launch the couroutines while Fragments use
the **viewLifeCycleOwner**
to observe data.
